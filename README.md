# auto-kmeans

auto-kmeans is a comprehensive Python framework designed to simplify and automate the process of clustering analysis using the K-means algorithm. This tool aims to provide users with an intuitive interface for performing robust K-means clustering on datasets, enabling both novices and experienced data scientists to extract meaningful insights from their data efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Clustering**: Streamlines the K-means clustering process, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters. This is an implementation of [this idea](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-approach-for-choosing-number-of-clusters-for-k-means-c28e614ecb2c).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data preprocessing functionalities to prepare datasets for clustering analysis.
- **Visualization**: Offers visualization tools to help interpret the results of the K-means algorithm.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate with existing data analysis pipelines and workflows.
- **Sample Datasets**: Comes with sample datasets to help users get started and to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies to get started with auto-kmeans:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nguyhu01/auto-kmeans.git
cd auto-kmeans
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installation, import autokmeans in your Python script to perform automated K-means clustering on your dataset.

```python

from autokmeans import AutoKMeans

# Initialize and fit the model to your data
auto_km = AutoKMeans(data, max_clusters, alpha_k)
auto_km.fit(data, clustering_features)

```
